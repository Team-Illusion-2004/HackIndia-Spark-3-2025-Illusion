Web3 Deepfake Detection Platform uses SingularityNET AI to detect deepfakes while integrating Cryptocurrency token staking and community verification. Users stake tokens to upload media, AI analyzes it, and the community votes on authenticity. If correctly flagged as a deepfake, the uploader gets rewards. 

Key Features

AI-Powered Deepfake Detection: Uses a pre-trained model deployed via SingularityNET.

Cryptocurrency Staking: Users stake crypto tokens before uploading media.

Community Verification: Other users vote if the uploaded media is real or fake.

Rewards System: If the community confirms the media is a deepfake, the uploader gets rewards.

Web3 Integration: Uses smart contracts to handle staking, rewards, and community voting.
